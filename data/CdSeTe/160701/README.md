#Co-Sputtered CdSeCdTe Films on SLG

###Samples/Measurements by R. Treharne

* 160628-B
  + CdTe:CdSe - 60:60 W | 200 degC | 5 mTorr | 30 min | Rot Off
* 160629-C
  + Bilayer structure. Same dep. param as 160628-B but CdTe deposited first for 30 min followed by CdSe for 30 min
* 100 pt scan at 60 deg | snake patter from top left

Samples remeasured at 60 deg and further angles measured at corner points of 160628-B. Folder contains some preliminary ellipsometry analysis. Thickness profile extracted from 160628-B with low (<5 typically) MSE values accross the sample. Two independent thickness profiles succesfully extracted from 160629-A (bi-layer sample) for CdTe and CdSe.
